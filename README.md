### MVP/PostMVP

The functionality will then be divided into two separate lists: MPV and PostMVP.  Carefully decided what is placed into your MVP as the client will expect this functionality to be implemented upon project completion.  

#### MVP 
*These are examples only. Replace with your own MVP features.*

- Creating functional new game button 
- Implement function trivia questions questions that link to the correct answer
- Incrementing the players score with every correct answer 
- Implementing functional multiple choice possibilities for answers
- Creating highest score button  that keeps track of the most recent highest score
- Reflect highest score on the page
- Keep track of players score and reflect it on the page
- Compare players score to highest score at end of game to see if highest score needs to be updated
- Reset every time new game button is clicked

#### PostMVP  
*These are examples only. Replace with your own Post-MVP features.*

- Add user sign up functionality 
- let users have the ablitlity to create a simple profile to keep track of their gaming history and communicate with other players
- make it a two player game 
- have usuers be able to submit questions to be possibly added to the game

## Project Schedule

This schedule will be used to keep track of your progress throughout the week and align with our expectations.  

You are **responsible** for scheduling time with your squad to seek approval for each deliverable by the end of the corresponding day, excluding `Saturday` and `Sunday`.

|  Day | Deliverable | Status
|---|---| ---|
|July 30| Prompt / Wireframes / Priority Matrix / Timeframes | Complete
|August 2| Project Approval / Core Application Structure (HTML, CSS, etc.) | Incomplete
|August 3| Pseudocode / actual code | Incomplete
|August 4| Initial Clickable Model  | Incomplete
|August 5| MVP | Incomplete
|August 6| Presentations | Incomplete

## Priority Matrix

Include a full list of features that have been prioritized based on the `Time and Importance` Matrix.  Link this image in a similar manner to your wireframes

## Timeframes

Tell us how long you anticipate spending on each area of development. Be sure to consider how many hours a day you plan to be coding and how many days you have available until presentation day.

Time frames are also key in the development cycle.  You have limited time to code all phases of the game.  Your estimates can then be used to evalute game possibilities based on time needed and the actual time you have before game must be submitted. It's always best to pad the time by a few hours so that you account for the unknown so add and additional hour or two to each component to play it safe. Throughout your project, keep track of your Time Invested and Actual Time and update your README regularly.

| Component | Priority | Estimated Time | Time Invested | Actual Time |
| --- | :---: |  :---: | :---: | :---: |
| Adding Form | H | 3hrs| 3.5hrs | 3.5hrs |
| Working with API | H | 3hrs| 2.5hrs | 2.5hrs |
| Total | H | 6hrs| 5hrs | 5hrs |
