## Code Snippet

const getData = async () => {
  try {
    const data = await axios.get(DOMAIN);
    let dataInfo = data.data.results;
    console.log(dataInfo);
    displayQuestion(dataInfo);
    displayAnswers(dataInfo);
  } catch (error) {
    console.log(error);
  }
};

getData();



## Change Log
Had so much trouble trying to get random questions to continue to generate without expiring the current game session.

Had to change my approach of how to generate correct answer randomly instead of hard coding the same correct answer for each question.
